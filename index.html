  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How do I become a programmer or software engineer? &mdash;
      There are many ways to learn to program, including formal courses, highly
      structured textbook-style books, tutorial sequences, video guides, and so
      on.  Which type you should use depends a bit on your choice of initial
      language, your preferred style, and your long term goals for what you will
      be learning.  If your goal is simply to start out exploring programming,
      then you should select a starting language useful for the area of
      programming you want to explore, and look or ask for sources to start
      with that language.  If your long term goal is to become a professional
      software engineer, then you should seriously consider seeking a
      structured formal education in the area, as this will set you up for a
      strong career by covering a lot of information that is hard to get one
      piece at a time.</li>
    <li>What language should I start with? &mdash;
      This answer will not dictate a language, but advise you on how to think
      about the question.  Good initial languages typically sample from the
      popularly used languages, as these will have a lot of supporting resources
      and communities available.  Which one you choose can depend a bit on your
      goals.  If you are entering programming as a hobby, then you should
      choose an initial language that is useful in your area of interest.  You
      can search for languages used for a particular purpose, or ask on the
      channel for opinions about what sorts of languages are good for a
      particular purpose.  If you are entering programming heading toward a
      long term career, perhaps as a software engineer, then it really doesn't
      matter too much what your first language is.  You can go ahead and choose
      an easy, popular, and/or useful language for your first one, and then
      expand your skills with a second language, and then a third, and so on.
      Each following language of a paradigm (a type of language) tends to be
      significantly easier to learn than one's first one, such that after
      picking up a few, it becomes fairly easy to learn many languages.</li>
    <li>How do I become highly skilled at programming? &mdash;
      Program...  a lot.  Study it formally, do it for work, do it in your spare
      time.  Great programmers tend to be people who really enjoy it, and
      therefore do it a lot for very many years.  To make your way to this
      point from a beginning stage, start working on progressively larger
      projects.  Make up project goals for yourself, and work through the full
      scale of a project to completion.  Then go again with another slightly
      larger project on a different topic, using different methods, or using a
      different language, and on again in an expanding loop.  And while you're
      doing this, don't be afraid to ask questions.</li>
